## Updates
🚩 **News** (2025.05): TQNet has been accepted to ICML 2025 and the paper and code is currently available.

**Please note that** [**SparseTSF**](https://github.com/lss-1138/SparseTSF), [**CycleNet**](https://github.com/ACAT-SCUT/CycleNet), and [**TQNet**](https://github.com/ACAT-SCUT/TQNet) represent our continued exploration of **leveraging periodicity** for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). 
The differences and connections among them are as follows:

## Introduction

**TQNet** is the powerful successor to [**CycleNet**](https://github.com/ACAT-SCUT/CycleNet) (our previous work, **NeurIPS 2024 *Spotlight***). While CycleNet introduces the use of *learnable vectors* to model periodic patterns within individual variables, it fails to effectively capture **inter-variable dependencies**.

To bridge this gap, **TQNet** leverages the same *periodically shifted learnable vectors* from CycleNet as **queries** in an attention mechanism, allowing the model to capture **global inter-variable correlations**. Meanwhile, **keys** and **values** are derived from the raw input data to encode **local sample-level information**, thereby fusing **global priors** with **local observations**.

TQNet adopts a **single-layer attention mechanism** and a **lightweight MLP**, resulting in a compact and efficient model design.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TQNet learns more **robust multivariate dependencies**, achieving **state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy** across **12 challenging real-world datasets**.

An ablation study on different Q-K configurations reveals that the **TQNet strategy**, which considers both **global** and **per-sample** correlations, consistently yields the best performance.
In contrast, variants that rely solely on either global or per-sample information lead to **suboptimal results**.

![image.png](Figures/Table3.png)

Further ablations highlight the **core contribution** of the proposed TQ technique.
In addition, **integration studies** confirm the **portability** and **effectiveness** of TQ in enhancing the forecasting capability of other existing models.

The figure below visualizes the t-SNE projections of the learned TQ vectors after training.
Strikingly, channels that are closer in the t-SNE space tend to share similar temporal patterns, while those farther apart exhibit distinct dynamics.
This indicates that the TQ technique effectively captures **intrinsic multivariate correlations**.

To further validate its effectiveness, we evaluate TQNet on a **multivariate-to-univariate** forecasting task—predicting one target variable using a varying number of input channels.
As shown in the figure below, incorporating even a moderate amount of covariate information significantly improves TQNet’s performance, highlighting its strength in modeling robust cross-variable dependencies.

Finally, thanks to its powerful **TQ technique** and **lightweight architecture**, TQNet delivers **exceptional forecasting accuracy** with **minimal computational overhead**.
Even when scaling to datasets with more variables, TQNet remains highly efficient, closely matching the speed of linear-based models like **DLinear**.
